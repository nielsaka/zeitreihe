2. add function for SVAR(p) data creation
3. consider coherent naming scheme -> would involve renaming... :-/
4. add tests for AR(p) and SVAR(p)
5. write custom code for LR test; test; compare to vars package
6. port code from legacy package on graphical criteria -> function to implement test

4. documentation missing: description of function and paramters
5. example cannot run successfully; problem with network drive?
6. need to declare imports??
  "Consider adding
  importFrom("graphics", "abline", "plot")
  importFrom("stats", "embed", "logLik", "pchisq", "qchisq", "quantile")"
7. covr() not running on windows machine -> try linux
8.port code from mcs project -> forecasts + forecast evaluation of AR(p) processes
9. extensive testing -> more robust and complete sanity checks
